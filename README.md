# Category Service

This application was written as a component of the Homeo application, but due to the migration from Kafka to MQ, I decided to put this microservice on my repository as an example.

The application was written using Java 17, Spring. In addition, it uses Kafka, PostgreSQL as db, oauth2.0 with Auth0, TestContainers, or Eureka as service discovery.
